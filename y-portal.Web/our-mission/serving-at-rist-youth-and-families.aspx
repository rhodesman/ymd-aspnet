These programs are based on the Search Institute’s model of developmental assets.</p>
                                                                <p>As defined by the Search Institute, developmental assets are the positive experiences young people need to succeed and thrive. The more assets youth have, the more likely they are to have positive attitudes towards school, healthy lifestyles and leadership potential. Our goal is to provide quality programming that intentionally increases and enriches the developmental assets present in children and youth’s lives with a strong emphasis on reinforcing the Y’s core values of caring, honesty, respect, and responsibility, and promoting healthier, more active lifestyles. Through strong community partnerships, we are able to reach these youth and positively influence their lives.</p>

Fit 'n Fun, a partnership between the Y of Central Maryland and CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield is a research -based, fun exercise, education and nutrition program intended to impact this alarming trend in Central Maryland. Enrolled children are pre- and post- tested for various indicators of physical fitness and are given homework which engages the whole family in thinking about diet and food choices. Our <a href="pdf/OUR-MISSION-Serving-at-Risk-Youth-Fit-n-Fun-Results.pdf"> results </a> are exciting indications that appropriate  interventions work. </p>

The program is designed to help prevent summer learning loss, increase graduation rates, equip youth with tools to obtain employment, improve self-esteem, and build character. Youth enrolled in this program get 8-weeks of productive summer engagement. They spend their mornings receiving academic support and developing skills, like how to apply for college, how to look for a job, how to prepare for interviews, and other workforce development skills. In the afternoons they receive real-world job placements and a stipend. The Y also helps make sure they have the basics for the job like soap, toothpaste and clean clothes so they can arrive at work feeling confident and cared for.</p>

This unique city-wide program seeks to work with primary grade children who are behind in reading skills. Mornings are spent in small group reading instruction and afternoons are designed to extend literacy experiences through enrichment.</p>
