This practice allows for a Y experience to be richer and more rewarding for the broad and diverse group of people who are Y people. That's why we work hard to raise funds through our <strong> Give Every Child a Chance Annual Campaign </strong> so that financial assistance towards Y programs and services is accessible to those who can’t otherwise afford a Y experience.The end result strengthens our whole community.</p>

                                                                 <p>Here are a few commonly asked questions many donors may have when considering making a gift to the Y:</p>
                                                                <p><strong>Q: Why should I contribute to the Y?</strong></p>
                                                                <p> <strong> A: </strong> The Y of Central Maryland is a volunteer-led, charitable organization that works collaboratively with community partners to improve the lives of children, adults, families, and the entire community. Our purpose is to strengthen and enrich the development of individuals and families through quality programs and services that build a healthy spirit, mind, and body for all. The Y serves people of all backgrounds, ages, capabilities, and income levels, providing financial assistance to those in need.</p>
                                                                 <p><strong>Q: Doesn’t my membership support the Y’s philanthropic efforts?</strong></p> 
                                                                <p> <strong> A: </strong> No. Membership fees paid to the Y allow us to operate and maintain our centers, pay our staff, etc. These fees do not aid us in our efforts to provide Y experiences to those who otherwise cannot afford them.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>Q: Can I direct my gift to stay in my community?</strong></p>
                                                                <p> <strong> A: </strong> Yes! Donors wishing to do so may direct their gift to Baltimore City or Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Harford, or Howard County, or they can chose to donate wherever the need is greatest. Donors may also specify a particular program if they wish (summer camp, preschool, before & after school enrichment, etc.).</p>
                                                                <p><strong>Q: How will my contribution be used?</strong></p>
                                                                <p> <strong> A: </strong> One hundred percent of donor contributions go to providing financial assistance for children, individuals and families in need who otherwise couldn’t afford our programs and services. Our goal is to provide Y experiences to all those seeking one, regardless of their ability to pay. We subsidize a wide range of programs and services that impact communities and community members throughout Central Maryland. The majority of the contributions we receive are used to provide scholarship for young people to participate in our before- and after-school enrichment programs and summer camp programs.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>Q: Where do the contributions go?</strong></p>
                                                                <p> <strong> A: </strong> Contributions vary by region and type each year. Funds are used to send children, who could otherwise not afford it, to Y Preschool, Y Before & After School Enrichment Programs, Y Camp and more. These at-risk children are located in Baltimore City, Anne Arundel County, Baltimore County, Carroll County, Harford County and Howard County. Where donations are allocated is determined by the donor. </p>
                                                                <p><strong>Q: Who provides funding to the Y?</strong></p>
                                                                <p> <strong> A: </strong> Our funding is generated from individual and corporate donors, foundations and grants, and the United Way of Central Maryland.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>Q: What other fundraising does the Y do?</strong></p>
                                                                <p> <strong> A: </strong> The expansion and/or building of local Family Center Y’s is accomplished through various Y capital development campaigns. These campaigns typically involve naming opportunities for various areas in our Y centers.
