                                                                <p>Throughout 2009, Y volunteers and staff worked tirelessly to help us develop a long-term strategic plan that would create the foundation for <strong> our focus through 2015 </strong>. Our strategic plan, known as A Healthy Y for a Healthier Central Maryland: Vision 2015 sets forth a roadmap which will enable us to grow from serving a little over 140,000 people today to reaching over 240,000, or 10% of Central Maryland’s families and individuals by 2015 – and becoming a primary catalyst to help them achieve their full potential in spirit, mind and body. We do this not as an end in and of itself, but as a means to influence lives on a large enough scale to have true impact and residual benefits to the health & well-being of the entire community.</p>

We are here toserve the community and to address critical needs inorder to help strengthen the community.

Our strategic plan starts with a clear-eyed assessment of some of the most pressing social challenges before us:</p>

                                                                        <br />

Indeed, the CDC has predicted that, without proper interventions, the next generation could be the first in history to live shorter lives than their parents.
                                                                    </li>

                                                                        <br />

                                                                    </li>
                                                                    <li><strong>Increased financial and social strains on families</strong>
                                                                        <br />
                                                                        It's no secret that families today are strained in many ways. Financial strain, divorce, loss of faith/spirituality and the impact of dual wage households pose major threats to the stability of families.
                                                                    </li>

When children are unsupervised after school, they are at-risk for dangerous social behaviors in far greater numbers than those who are productively engaged in after-school programs.
                                                                    </li>

In fact, the divide between urban and suburban graduation rates in Maryland is the highest in the nation and the gap is growing each year.
                                                                    </li>

The challenges they face to attain employment, housing and financial stability are exponentially greater than of those who do graduate from high school.</p>
