We pioneered the practice of swim lessons over 160 years ago and have taught generations of families how to swim. Our expertise and leadership in swimming sets us apart and our warm, patient approach to teaching sets you at ease.</p>

Whether you're new to swimming or refining your skills, all participants from age 6 months to 60+ years can comfortably learn at their own pace, progress at their own pace, and become strong, safe swimmers at their own pace!</p>
